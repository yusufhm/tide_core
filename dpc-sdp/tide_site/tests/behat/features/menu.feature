Feature: Sites menu autocreate

  As a site admin, I want to be able to automatically create and assign new
  Main and Footer menus to sites and sections on:
  - new site creation
  - new section creation
  - editing existing site
  - editing existing section

  Background:
    Given vocabulary "sites" with name "Sites" exists
    And no "sites" terms:
      | Test 1 |
    And no menus:
      | site-main-menu-test-1           |
      | site-main-menu-test-1-test-11   |
      | site-footer-menu-test-1         |
      | site-footer-menu-test-1-test-11 |

  @api
  Scenario: Menu autocreate - new and existing sites
    Given I am logged in as a user with the "administer taxonomy" permission
    And I go to "admin/structure/taxonomy/manage/sites/add"
    And I fill in "Name" with "Test 1"
    And I fill in "Domains" with "test.example.com"
    And I see field "Main menu"
    And I see field "autocreate_main_menu"
    And the "autocreate_main_menu" checkbox should be checked
    And I see field "Footer menu"
    And I see field "autocreate_footer_menu"
    And the "autocreate_footer_menu" checkbox should be checked

    # Assert auto-creation and association.
